      <div className="subtext">
        There are always a few visits from Aunt Flo that we chicas always dread.
        Even though it is totally normal to have an 'oh-no' moment, so when it
        happens, all you have to do is laugh and remember it’s natural!! &lt;3.

      <h4>Reality Checks - </h4>
      <div className="text">
        <p>
          I was born and raised in North America, and last summer, I visited
          India for the first time as an adult. I stayed in Mumbai for about one
          month, so...you know, approximately one cycle. While I was there, I
          was passed around among all my relatives, old and young, and one of
          them decided to take me to an old temple in the city.
        </p>
        <p>I happened to be on my period.</p>
        <p>
          Before we entered the temple, the relative asked me point-blank if I
          was "clean," or if it was my "monthly time." I was taken aback, but of
          course I knew exactly what she was asking. I confirmed that I was
          "clean," with total awareness that there was a wad of cotton lodged in
          my vagina. So then I walked into the temple, disintegrating uterine
          lining and all, and the world did not end. The temple was not defiled.
          The gods did not smite me. I prayed and I left.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's the end of the story. I guess it's not really a "weird
          period experience." It was a pretty normal period, more or less the
          same as all of my others. But it was pretty weird to learn that some
          of my own family members, whom I had always believed to be relatively
          progressive, still espoused the archaic nonsense that menstruation is
          dirty and profane. It's absolutely not.

      <h4>Chivalry was never dead:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        <p>
          The way my <b>MALE</b> teacher handled it was awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          *realising I’d started my period and wasn’t prepared for it* “Mr
          Jones, may I be excused please?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr Jones must have realised I looked upset or something because he
          came over to my desk and asked me quietly if I needed his coat to
          cover myself. I nodded and started to stand up, but he told me to wait
          where I was.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Hey, you look cold. Have you got the flu? Here, take my coat. Go and
          see the nurse.” He put his coat around me and saw me out of the room.
          When we were outside he said “I’m really sorry, I don’t have anything
          you can change into. My wife can help you, she’s in her room on admin
          time. Our daughter is going through the same thing, so if you tell her
          you need help she will know what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to Mrs Jones’s room, and sure enough when she saw the coat she
          leapt to action. She had spare underwear, skirts, tights and pads. I
          put them in my bag, got changed in the bathroom and collected myself.
          I went back to the lesson, telling Mr Jones I was feeling okay after
          some fresh air and water, and nobody was any the wiser because the
          skirt was a uniform so looked no different.
        </p>
        <p>
          That couple handled the situation like absolute bosses, and made the
          whole thing much easier to cope with. I always knew after that if I
          got caught out I could go to at least one teacher for spare pads. I’ll
          never forget them.

      <h4>PCOS Pandemonium:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        <p>
          I have PCOS, which means my periods are wildly unpredictable and that
          when they do show up, they mean business. We're talking opening the
          floodgates, full on WWIII in my pants. So, of course, the last time my
          period was in full swing was the same day I needed to wait in line for
          three hours for the launch of a new NASA Lego set. I tried everything
          to slow the flow, including popping ibuprofen like candy and putting
          in the menstrual cup I use only in emergencies. But that still wasn't
          enough. A menstrual cup is supposed to last 10 hours for a normal
          period. For mine, it lasts mayyybe two. So by the time I made it
          through the line, got into the store to grab my Lego set, had it
          signed by the designer, and asked her a few questions, I could feel
          the blood leaking out of the cup onto the backup pad I had also put
          on. I grabbed my roommate, ran to a McDonald's, and tried to open the
          locked ladies' room door for about two minutes before I barreled into
          the mens' room. Luckily, it was a single-stall bathroom and I had
          plenty of space to deal with the overflowing cup, which obviously
          spilled all over my hand when I pulled it out. So I'm sitting there
          for a good seven minutes with my bloodied pants around my ankles
          trying to 1) pull the cup out, 2) clean it and myself, 3) put it back
          in, and then 4) clean up the blood that spilled on the toilet seat and
          the floor in the process. When I finally exited the bathroom, there
          was a line of men four people deep waiting to get in. I just shot them
          all a smile and walked away."

          "I was the first of my friends to have my period, and I didn't really
          know what to expect. When I got the tampon in [on] the first try, I
          was so proud of myself. However, about an hour later, I wanted to
          check in (yes, I realize how crazy that sounds now). The tampon
          wouldn't come out. Not understanding truly how tampons work, I thought
          it was stuck in me forever. I screamed at my mother to come to
          bathroom and help.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Once she understood what was happening, she laughed so hard, she fell
          into the tub. Next, my dad came up to make sure we were okay. [He]
          opened the door, ran out, and laughed hysterically from outside.
          Finally, my little sister, not old enough to understand anything other
          than [that] I had done something funny, started laughing. It's not
          exactly the bonding that I had in mind, and it turned me off tampons
          for years."

      <h4>World’s best dad of the year goes too…:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        "It was the first week of sixth grade. I was called up to write on the
        blackboard and thought I was super cute in my new white shorts. As soon
        as I got to the board, the whole class started laughing. I started my
        period and bled through my white shorts. I was sent to the nurse's
        office to have my parents bring me a change of clothes. My poor dad was
        the one who got the call. He was so flustered he entered through the
        cafeteria door carrying four bags of feminine products while yelling,
        'Does anyone know where to find Michelle? My baby girl is now a woman
        and needs supplies.' Basically every student, teacher, and staff member
        was well aware that I got my first period. Bless his heart, he was
        trying."
