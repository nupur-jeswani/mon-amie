            <h4>A not-so-deadly experience:</h4>
            <div>
                So it was february or march of 2007 and I was attending school like every other day. I was feeling something strange between my legs. It was ofcourse unusual but I considered to ignore it. Fortunately, we had dark blue color winter skirt so the stain did not show up. I reached home, ate lunch and when I went to change my clothes, what I saw was completely shocking and unbelievable. I came to realize from where I was bleeding and that was the reason of feeling so unusual that day. I was unable to fathom the situation. I started crying because I thought I was going to die. Yes so this was the thought that struck me first. I kept crying because I thought this was the end of my life. My whole world fell apart by seeing a lot of bood on my thighs.

                I opened the door of my room slightly and called out my mom. I was sobbing and explained what was happening to me. She stood there emotionless, then brought pad and explained to me how to wear it.

            <h4>Proud to bleed:</h4>
            <div>
                When I was seven we were on holiday with my mom’s best friend and her teenage daughter. I saw her pads and wanted to know what they were, so several books were bought and I was well prepared.

                Fast forward two years and while on holiday with a friend and her family I stumble into the bathroom, half-asleep, at 6 a.m. Cue toilet paper, dark color, exhausted confusion — and then jubilation! I was a woman! I ran through the house hooting, got the mom to call my parents and was proudly unable to swim that day.

            <h4>Fearsome Fourteen:</h4>
            <div>
                It was the 2nd day of final exams of 7th grade. I was casually sitting on the bed when I had my eyes stuck on the huge patch of blood stain on the bedsheet. Crying, I called my mom who couldn’t control her laughter seeing my reaction to Lady Red. We are pretty understanding about the situation and helped me throughout the 14 days of pain and bleeding.
