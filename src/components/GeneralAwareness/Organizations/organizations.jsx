        <p>¡Hola señoritas! Comos estas?</p>
        We all know there is a lot of taboo behind menstruation. Even in the
        21st century, people practice these outdated customs. This was realised
        by many organizations, NGOs, institutions and governments.
        <br />
        In India, since there is a dire need to create awareness on
        menstruation, all these schemes are put in place in full swings are are
        effective too!

        India has more than <b> 355 million menstruating women</b>. Out of this,
        only
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>36 percent</b> user sanitary napkins
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>71 percent</b> of adolescent girls remain unaware of menstruation
          until their first menstrual cycle. In fact, their first sighting of
          blood accompanied by pain and other physical symptoms causes them to
          believe that they are either dying or have caught some horrible
          infection.
        </li>
      </div>
      <div className="text">
        The stigma surrounding menstruation has led to women falling behind; the
        impact is visible on their health as well as education. Unhygienic
        practices and carelessness can lead to cervical cancer, reproductive
        tract infections, Hepatitis B infection, yeast infections and urinary
        tract infection. More serious illnesses like TSS can lead to death.
        Almost 23 million girls drop out of school annually as they lack
        awareness as well as access to hygiene, bathrooms, sanitary napkins.
        <br />
        There are also wide disparities between the condition of women in urban
        and rural areas. Sanitary napkins are still a luxury for many women,
        especially in rural areas. The accessibility to menstrual hygiene
        products is correlated to one’s income.

      <h4>Government's Role - </h4>
      <div className="text">
        While in the last decade, our policymakers have started focusing on
        menstruation and related issues, the improvement is not praiseworthy. In
        2011, menstrual hygiene scheme was launched under the National Health
        Mission (NHM) to promote menstrual hygiene amongst girls of 10-19 years.
        In 2014, Rashtriya Kishore Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) was launched to
        educate adolescent girls about menstruation and increase their
        accessibility to sanitary pads. State governments have also launched
        their own schemes. On 15 August 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi
        became the first Prime Minister of our country to address menstrual
        health as not just a problem affecting women, but as a matter of public
        health. A much neglected but necessary part of public health, his
        remarks gave renewed impetus to our healthcare system to focus on this
        issue. In light of those remarks, it is imperative to take a look at the
        condition of women, government efforts in this regard, as well as what
        can be done by the state and the people to improve the status of
        menstrual health in our country.
        <br />
        In Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra
        Pradesh and Kerala, state governments distribute free sanitary napkins
        in schools. In Bihar, adolescent girls are given Rs 300 under the
        Kishori Swasthya Yojana to buy sanitary pads. In fact, the Bihar
        government offers two days of menstrual leave to its female employees
        every month — women can take their days off on any days of the month
        with no justification. Towards the end of last year, Andhra Pradesh
        state government launched a scheme whereby monthly awareness classes
        will be taken for students studying in classes VII to XII.
        <br />
        Menstrual Hygiene Day (MH Day) is organized on May 28 to raise awareness
        of the challenges women and girls worldwide face due to their
        menstruation and to highlight solutions that address these challenges.
        MH Day is a global platform that brings together non-government
        organizations, government agencies, the private sector, the media and
        individuals to promote menstrual hygiene management (MHM). MH day is
        initiated by WASH United in 2013; and on 28 May 2014, it was celebrated
        for the first time.

      <h4>Activities to promote menstrual hygiene management in India:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        <li>
          The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE)
          (2009) includes standards for drinking water and gender-separated
          sanitation facilities in schools.
        </li>
        <li>
          Menstrual hygiene scheme launched by Ministry of Health and Family
          Welfare, Government of India (GoI) for promotion of menstrual hygiene
          among adolescent girls (10-19 years) in rural areas of selected
          districts in 2011. From 2014 onwards scheme extended to all districts
          under Rashtriya Kishore Swasthya Karyakram to enhance MH knowledge,
          improve hygiene practices, provide subsidised sanitary absorbents, and
          raise awareness of MHM at school.
        </li>
        <li>
          SABLA programme of Ministry of Women and Child Development focuses on
          nutrition, health, hygiene and reproductive and sexual health (linked
          to rural mother and child care centres).
        </li>
        <li>
          National Rural Livelihood Mission of the Ministry of Rural Development
          supports self-help groups and small manufacturers to produce sanitary
          pads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Swachh Bharat Mission and Swachh Bharat: Swachh Vidyalaya (SB:SV):
          Menstrual hygiene management is also an integral part of the Swachh
          Bharat Mission and the ‘Menstrual Hygiene Management Guideline’ issued
          by the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation(MDWS) involves the
          support from state governments, district administrations, engineers
          and technical experts in line departments; and school head teachers
          and teachers for its implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guidelines for Gender Issues in Sanitation (2017) have been evolved by
          MDWS to ensure gender equality and empowerment of women and girls with
          respect to sanitation
        </li>
        <li>
          Safe and effective MHM is a trigger for better and stronger
          development for adolescent girls and women. This requires that all
          state, district and local authorities, including schools, communities
          and families create an environment where menstrual hygiene management
          is seen as acceptable and normal.
        </li>
      </div>

      <h4>NGO's Role - </h4>
      <p className="text">
        According to the World Health Organistaion, around the world, 1.8
        billion women menstruate every month, yet at least 500 million of
        them—mostly in developing countries—lack the knowledge and means to
        manage their menstrual health safely and with dignity.
      </p>
      <p className="text">
        <b>Period poverty</b> — defined as the lack of understanding of
        menstruation and necessary sanitation—is widespread. For example, in
        India, according to a study by UNESCO and P&G (2021), with 40 crore
        menstruating women, less than 20 percent use sanitary napkins compared
        to a significantly higher number (65 percent) using cosmetic products
        such as lipsticks. The same study revealed that 71 percent of adolescent
        girls remain unaware of menstruation until their first menstrual cycle,
        affecting their health, confidence, and self-esteem.
        <li>
          On 2 January 2021, Raigarh district in Chhattisgarh launched ‘Pavna’,
          a unique community-based menstrual hygiene programme. According to a
          study by the Women and Child Development department of the district,
          before Pavna was launched, 40 percent of women (out of the 160,000
          women who menstruate) in the district were using sanitary pads, which
          after Pavna’s implementation increased to 75 percent by March 2022,
          with 530 villages (out of 774) achieving 100 percent sanitary pad
          usage. The initiative envisages ensuring universal menstrual hygiene
          through indigenous strategies, based on three principles: Access,
          Awareness and Acceptance to bring a turnaround in behaviour and usage
          patterns. To channelise resources from multiple sources, the
          convergence of multiple government schemes was ensured.

          Humjoli foundation started educating the society in 2018 and till now
          the organization has conducted over 350 awareness sessions in 10
          cities of India. The reach of the organization has been more than
          50,000 women in the country.

          On International Women’s Day in 2017, Sunita Gupta, Director, Kent RO
          Systems Limited, decided she was going to help women in far-flung
          villages. She broke the taboo around the subject of menstruation by
          speaking unhesitatingly about it to both, women and men.
          <br />
          Gradually inhibitions dropped as she took the lead to set up a unit
          run by women and supported by men for packing menstruation cloth and
          traditional underwear (langot) to women and girls among remote
          communities. The softest cotton material is procured and handstitched
          and packed at these units. The cloth pads thus created is reusable and
          washable and hygienic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members of Kent Foundation (the CSR arm of Kent RO Group) sat down on
          March 20 with women in the unit and made their first batch of handmade
          sanitary towels as a sign of commitment. The first recipient of 600
          packs of 15 cloth pads was The Grameen Foundation, Jehanabad Bihar,
          whose Director Birender Sharma carried out the campaign with the help
          of volunteers from nonprofit YUVATI (Youth Under Voluntary Action for
          Transportation), which works in the field of girl child education.
          Kent Foundation and Rotary International District 3011 signed an MoU
          for implementation of menstrual hygiene education and awareness
          programme – Kadam Sapno Ki Aur. The drive is likely to benefit over
          1.20 lakhs women and girls in rural India. In an endeavour to educate
          and make women and adolescent girls aware of this issue, Kent
          Foundation has adopted a multipronged approach to educate and provide
          them sanitary napkins.

          Khyati Gupta, 16, realised she needed to make a difference when she
          learned from their maid's daughter that she didn't have enough money
          to buy sanitary pads. Pinkishe was born, and because of it, thousands
          of girls have not only learned more about their monthly cycle but have
          also received access to better menstrual hygiene through the
          distribution of free sanitary napkins.
        </li>
        <li>
          In Indian society, where discussing period is forbidden, knowledge of
          menstruation and hygiene behaviours is restricted by stigma and
          taboos. Myna is addressing the source of the problem of the menstrual
          hygiene management. Myna is raising awareness about menstruation and
          distributing cheap sanitary products directly to the women in need in
          the Govandi slum dweller communities.
          <br />
          By producing low-cost, high-quality sanitary napkins that are more
          affordable than what is currently available on the market and selling
          them on a door-to-door basis, Myna is able to reach out to women who
          would normally not leave their house, for a variety of reasons, to go
          buy pads at a nearby chemist and begin the conversation to break the
          taboo.
