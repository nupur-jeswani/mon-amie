            <h5>Hey bellas! While many of us have the luxury to have feminine hygiene pads and all the necessary information regarding Lady Red, many of us fellow belles don’t have all these things.</h5>
            <h5>This is a safe space created by us girls for you girls to share your stories and lift the heavy weight off your chests.</h5>

            <h4>Lack of basic hygiene and lack of understanding of what menstruation is - resulted in the Taboo.</h4>

                <div>
                    <h6>Ancient women lacked the modern luxury like pads, tampons.</h6>
                    So, women were largely confined to separate rooms with just a piece of cloth to wear. They remained separated until the periods was over and were not allowed to touch anything.

                    Charaka Samhita says,
                    <br />
                    After the onset of menstruation, for 3 days and nights, the woman should observe celibacy, should sleep on the ground, take food with hands from and unbroken utensil and should not cleanse her body in any way.

                    Scriptures especially Dharmashastras kept reiterating that a menstruating women is a bad omen ,touching her or associating with her was seen as a crime.
                    <p><i>Manu(4.41) : Of the man who approaches a woman covered with impurity,—intelligence, vitality, strength, sight and longevity wear off.</i></p>
                    <p><i>Gautama (9.30-31).—‘Not when she is in her courses;—nor shall he embrace her in this condition.’</i></p>
                    <p><i>Vaśiṣṭha (12.4).—‘He shall not associate with a woman with dirty clothes: nor with one in her courses; nor with one who is unfit.’</i></p>
                    <p><i>Viṣṇu (69.11).—‘Not when she is impure.’</i></p>
                    <p><i>Gobhila (3.5.5).—‘Not when she is in her courses.’</i></p>
                    <p><i>Bṛhannāradīya (28, 87-88).—‘If one touch a woman in her courses, or a Cāṇḍāla, or one who has committed a heinous crime, or a newly delivered woman, or the leavings of food, or the washerman and such others,—he shall bathe forthwith with his clothes on, etc., etc.’</i></p>
                    <p><i>Viṣṇupurāṇa (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 562).—‘One shall not approach his wife before she has bathed or when she is ill, or in her courses.’[2]</i></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    Unfortunately, such customs and traditions are still followed in rural areas. Mensrtuating girls are not allowed to touch food by themselves, forbidden to enter temples and many more things. They are confined in their own houses by such outdated practices.

                    Some of the girls had the courage to speak up and share their experiences.

            <h4>All tense and worried:</h4>
            <div>
                <div>
                    I grew up in a house full of women, but we still never discussed openly one of nature's most normal rites of passage. My mother used to cut up old bed sheets and hide them in a box, ready to be used by her four young daughters.
                </div>
                <div>
                    The biggest challenge was to dry those pieces of cloth. I have vivid memories of feeling tense and worried about the whole process.
                    <br />
                    I was taught the trick by my elder sisters - how to slip these stained clothes under other clothes without any men noticing them. We could not risk putting them out in the open under the sun to dry completely.

            <h4>Dirty is not the way</h4>
            <div>
                <div>
                    My mother made me use clothes to help with the bleeding. Since there was not much money in the house, the clothes had to be reused. The result was that they never got properly dry, leaving a horrible stench. The unhygienic cloth got used over and over again. Lack of water made the cleaning process even more cumbersome and unhygienic.
                    I was made fun of due to the stench. So much that I had to quit school in class 5.

                    True story ladies, many recent studies show that these practices constitute a serious threat to health. It's reported that at least one in five girls in India drop out of school due to menstruation.

            <h4>Why so ‘in’human:</h4>
            <div>
                Fifteen-year-old Margdarshi lives in a remote village in Uttarakashi. She wants to be a doctor and wonders why boys in her biology class laugh so much when the teacher explains the process of menstruation.
                "I hate it. I wish we could be more relaxed and feel comfortable talking about it. This happens to every woman so what is there to laugh about?"
            </div>

            <h4>It’s not a secret:</h4>
            <div>
                “Although I am not stopped from using common areas but whenever there are male relatives around or there are guests at home during my period time, I am asked to be extra careful. The whole idea is to ensure that no one gets a whiff that I am on my periods,” said Sreeja, a local resident of a village in Hyderabad.

            <div>
                Right from having to hide the fact that they are on a period, to buying sanitary products wrapped in black paper bags and avoiding social functions, visiting religious places are all part of the taboo.
                <br />
                Such social barriers hamper the wellbeing of women.
                <br />
                Many initiatives have been taken by the government, different institutions to create more awareness regarding these taboo topics.
