        Hey girls!
        <br />
        When it comes to your period, you may have more questions than answers.
        When does it start? <br />
        How often does it come? <br />
        Can certain foods affect how you feel? <br />
        In your search for details, you may have found information you think is
        factual. But some of it may be a myth, instead.
        <br />
        We are here to BUST some of those MYTHS!

      <h4>
        Myth: You should get your first period before you’re 14 years of age.
      </h4>
      <h4>Fact: </h4>
      <div className="text">
        <li>
          Most individuals get their first period between 11 and 14 years of
          age. But every body is different. Don’t worry if you get yours when
          you’re younger or older than that. However, if you don’t have your
          first period by the time you’re 15 years of age, talk to your doctor.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to get an idea of when you’ll start having periods, your
          body may give you clues. Your first period usually comes about 2 years
          after your breasts start to develop. You may also notice you begin
          having vaginal discharge. That usually happens between 6 and 12 months
          before your period begins.
        </li>
      </div>

      <h4>Myth: You should skip your workout while on your period.</h4>
      <h4>Fact:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        Grab your weights or hit the gym, even during your period. Not only is
        exercise great for your body, it may help reduce the pain of menstrual
        cramps. A good workout also can relieve stress. Cardio is best, even
        something as simple as a brisk walk around the block. The key is to
        exercise all month, not just during your period. Aim for at least 30
        minutes a day, 5 days a week
      </div>

      <h4>Myth: You shouldn’t skip your period.</h4>
      <h4>Fact:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        It is not uncommon to skip a period every once in a while. There are
        many reasons. You may miss a month if you’re under a lot of stress,
        you’re exercising more, or you’ve started or stopped using hormonal
        birth control. Additionally, irregular periods are common in individuals
        who have just started menstruating and people who are close to
        menopause. There are other reasons, too. If you miss two periods in a
        row, talk with your doctor. They will likely do a pregnancy test. If
        you’re not pregnant, they can help you determine next steps.

      <h4>Myth: Women shed impure blood during periods.</h4>
      <h4>Fact:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        This is an extremely common misconception that period blood is dirty or
        impure. However, what most people fail to understand is that the
        menstrual cycle is part of a woman’s reproductive system that prepares
        her body for a (possible) pregnancy. The menstrual blood is also the
        same blood that circulates throughout the body.
        <br />
        The clumping and color of period blood have their scientific causes too.
        Women shed partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus.
        In addition, the color may range from light red to dark brown. The
        change in color from standard red occurs due to the reaction of blood
        with oxygen (it gets time to oxidize). Dark brown or blackish color is
        usually associated with the beginning or end of your periods.

      <h4>Myth: You shouldn’t wash your hair during your period.</h4>
      <h4>Fact:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        You don’t need to compromise with your personal hygiene habits due to
        your periods. There is no study that states one cannot wash your hair or
        take a shower on your period. In fact, a warm bath can help you with the
        painful cramps.
      </div>

      <h4>Myth: If you use a tampon, you lose your virginity.</h4>
      <h4>Fact:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        While it is true that tampons may cause the hymen to stretch which a few
        times may cause breaking of the hymen, it does not cause someone to lose
        their virginity. Virginity is much beyond just the hymen. The hymen can
        be naturally broken due to strenuous activities like cycling too.
        However, usually, when a tampon is inserted, the hymen will stretch to
        accommodate it, so the odds of affecting a woman’s virginity can be
        less.
      </div>

      <h4>Myth: Hot water increases period flow.</h4>
      <h4>Fact:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        The good news and the bad news: pretty much the only thing that will
        change your flow is your own body. So you can’t make it lighter
        (sorry!), and you can’t make it heavier. And a nice warm bath or shower,
        or a hot water bottle wrapped in a towel can help with cramps.
      </div>

      <h4>Myth: Irregular periods are bad for your reproductive health.</h4>
      <h4>Fact:</h4>
      <div className="text">
        <p>
          First, talk to your health care provider if you’ve missed your period.
          It can take anywhere from 6 months to a year to become regular after
          the first time you get it. And, for some girls, it never becomes
          completely regular. There are lots of things, including stress,
          illness and intense exercise, that can mess with your cycle. That’s
          why you should consult a heath professional first.
