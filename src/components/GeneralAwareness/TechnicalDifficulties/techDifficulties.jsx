      <h4>
        Managing menstruation in the workplace: an overlooked issue in low- and
        middle-income countries
      </h4>

      <div className="text">
        The potential menstrual hygiene management barriers faced by adolescent
        girls and women in workplace environments in low- and middle-income
        countries has been under addressed in research, programming and policy.
        Despite global efforts to reduce poverty among women in such contexts,
        there has been insufficient attention to the water and sanitation
        related barriers, specifically in relation to managing monthly
        menstruation, that may hinder girls’ and women’s contributions to the
        workplace, and their health and wellbeing. There is an urgent need to
        document the specific social and environmental barriers they may be
        facing in relation to menstrual management, to conduct a costing of the
        implications of inadequate supportive workplace environments for
        menstrual hygiene management, and to understand the implications for
        girls’ and women’s health and wellbeing. This will provide essential
        evidence for guiding national policy makers, the private sector, donors
        and activists focused on advancing girls’ and women’s rights.

      <h4>
        Menstrual Hygiene, Management, and Waste Disposal: Practices and
        Challenges Faced by Girls/Women of Developing Countries
      </h4>

      <div className="text">
        Menstruation and menstrual practices still face many social, cultural,
        and religious restrictions which are a big barrier in the path of
        menstrual hygiene management. In many parts of the country especially in
        rural areas girls are not prepared and aware about menstruation so they
        face many difficulties and challenges at home, schools, and work places.
        While reviewing literature, we found that little, inaccurate, or
        incomplete knowledge about menstruation is a great hindrance in the path
        of personal and menstrual hygiene management. Girls and women have very
        less or no knowledge about reproductive tract infections caused due to
        ignorance of personal hygiene during menstruation time. In rural areas,
        women do not have access to sanitary products or they know very little
        about the types and method of using them or are unable to afford such
        products due to high cost. So, they mostly rely on reusable cloth pads
        which they wash and use again. Needs and requirements of the adolescent
        girls and women are ignored despite the fact that there are major
        developments in the area of water and sanitation. Women manage
        menstruation differently when they are at home or outside; at homes,
        they dispose of menstrual products in domestic wastes and in public
        toilets and they flush them in the toilets without knowing the
        consequences of choking. So, there should be a need to educate and make
        them aware about the environmental pollution and health hazards
        associated with them. Implementation of modern techniques like
        incineration can help to reduce the waste. Also, awareness should be
        created to emphasize the use of reusable sanitary products or the
        natural sanitary products made from materials like banana fibre, bamboo
        fibre, sea sponges, water hyacinth, and so on.
