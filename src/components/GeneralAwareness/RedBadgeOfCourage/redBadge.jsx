                        Menstruation is when the lining of the uterus sheds, breaking down into blood. This blood then leaves the body through the vagina. It is also known as a period.
                        <br />
                        Periods usually last around 3–7 daysTrusted Source. During this time, a person who is menstruating bleeds from the vagina. They may also experience other symptoms, such as cramping.
                        <br />
                        Menstruation stops when someone is pregnant, so having a period means a person is not pregnant. It also marks the beginning of a new menstrual cycle. This cycle of fertility affects most females from their teenage years through to menopause when periods stop.
                        <br />
                        Periods happen due to the menstrual cycle. This is the rise and fall of hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, that influence female fertility over the course of around 21–35 daysTrusted Source.
                        <br />
                        Fertility peaks roughly halfway through the cycle with ovulation, which is when the ovaries release an egg. This causes the uterine lining to thicken in preparation for a potential pregnancy. If no sperm fertilizes the egg, the uterus sheds this lining, and the cycle begins again.
                        <br />
                        The length of someone’s cycle, the duration of their periods, and the day they ovulate vary from person to person. Sometimes, it also differs from cycle to cycle.

                        A person’s first period indicates that the menstrual cycle has begun. Doctors refer to this as menarche. For most females, it occurs between the ages of 9–15Trusted Source, with the average age being 12.4 years.
                        <br />
                        A period is one of the signs of puberty, which is the beginning of a journey toward sexual maturity. This likely means that it is possible to get pregnant.
                        <br />
                        However, a person can become pregnant from the first time they ovulate, which means it is possible to get pregnant before the first period.
                        <br />
                        Other Signs of puberty include -
                        <ol>
                            <li>growth spurts</li>
                            <li>increased fat on the hips, thighs, and buttocks</li>
                            <li>developing more body hair, especially on the legs and under the arms</li>
                            <li>growing pubic hair</li>
                        </ol>
                        Most young people develop breasts about 2.5 years before menarche. If a person does not get their first period within 5 years of breast development, doctors consider this delayed menarche
