            Menstruation is when the lining of the uterus sheds, breaking down
            into blood. This blood then leaves the body through the vagina. It
            is also known as a period.
          </li>
          <li>
            Periods usually last around 3–7 daysTrusted Source. During this
            time, a person who is menstruating bleeds from the vagina. They may
            also experience other symptoms, such as cramping.
          </li>
          <li>
            Menstruation stops when someone is pregnant, so having a period
            means a person is not pregnant. It also marks the beginning of a new
            menstrual cycle. This cycle of fertility affects most females from
            their teenage years through to menopause when periods stop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Periods happen due to the menstrual cycle. This is the rise and fall
            of hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, that influence
            female fertility over the course of around 21–35 daysTrusted Source.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fertility peaks roughly halfway through the cycle with ovulation,
            which is when the ovaries release an egg. This causes the uterine
            lining to thicken in preparation for a potential pregnancy. If no
            sperm fertilizes the egg, the uterus sheds this lining, and the
            cycle begins again.
          </li>
          <li>
            The length of someone’s cycle, the duration of their periods, and
            the day they ovulate vary from person to person. Sometimes, it also
            differs from cycle to cycle.

            A person’s first period indicates that the menstrual cycle has
            begun. Doctors refer to this as menarche. For most females, it
            occurs between the ages of 9–15 Trusted Source, with the average age
            being 12.4 years.
          </li>

          <li>
            A period is one of the signs of puberty, which is the beginning of a
            journey toward sexual maturity. This likely means that it is
            possible to get pregnant.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, a person can become pregnant from the first time they
            ovulate, which means it is possible to get pregnant before the first
            period.

              Most young people develop breasts about 2.5 years before menarche.
              If a person does not get their first period within 5 years of
              breast development, doctors consider this delayed menarche
