            <h1>When your monthly visitor is late:</h1>

            <div>
                Hey gals! Did you just ever sit by the window and wait for your “visitor to come”, overthinking about the possible and impossible causes?
                <br />
                The “visitor” can be late due to many reasons. Let’s discuss some of them to keep that overthinking of yours at bay.
            </div>

            <h4>Stress:</h4>
            <div>
                Chronic stress can throw off your hormones, change your daily routine, and even affect the part of your brain responsible for regulating your period: your hypothalamus. Over time, stress can lead to illness or sudden weight gain or loss, all of which can impact your cycle.
                <br />
                If you think stress might be throwing off your period, try practicing relaxation techniques and making lifestyle changes.
                <br />
                Chronic stress can also affect other health conditions you’re living with, so addressing it yourself, or with the help of a medical professional, is an important part of taking care of your overall well-being.
            </div>

            <h4>Obesity:</h4>
            <div>
                Obesity can cause the body to produce an overabundance of estrogen, which is a key reproductive hormone. Too much estrogen can cause irregularities in your cycle, and may even stop your periods altogether.
                <br />
                If your doctor has determined that obesity is a factor in your late or missed periods, they may advise you to lose weight through lifestyle changes, such as a focusing on nutrient-dense foods and exercising.
            </div>

            <h4>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)</h4>
            <div>
                Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition that causes your body to produce more of the male hormone androgen. Cysts form on the ovaries as a result of this hormone imbalance. This can make ovulation irregular or stop it altogether.
                <br />
                Other hormones, such as insulin, may also become unbalanced. This is due to insulin resistance, which is often associated with PCOS.
                <br />
                Treatment for PCOS focuses on relieving symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe birth control or another medication to help regulate your cycle.
            </div>

            <h4>Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)</h4>
            <div>
                Most vagina owners begin menopause between the ages of 45 to 55. Those who develop symptoms around age 40 or earlier may be experiencing premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), or early natural menopause.
                <br />
                About 1 percent of women in the United States experience POI. While this condition can arise from the surgical removal of the ovaries, other causes include genetic disorders and autoimmune conditions.
                <br />
                If you’re experiencing missed periods and you’re 40 years old or younger, contact your doctor to talk about POI testing and treatment.
            </div>

            <h4>Extreme diet and exercise</h4>
            <div>
                A healthy diet and regular exercise can do wonders for your health. But if you overdo it, you might say bye-bye to your periods, at least temporarily.
                <br />
                “Athletes who train really hard or who don’t get enough calories may stop menstruating,” Dr. Higgins says. “It’s the body’s way of telling you that it doesn’t have enough resources to support a pregnancy.”
                <br />
                When your periods stop due to weight loss, diet or exercise, you’re experiencing secondary amenorrhea. This means you previously had periods, but they have stopped.
            </div>

            <div>
                These are some of the most common reasons for amenorrhea. But don’t you be worried mon amie, like every issue, this also has multiple solutions!
                <br />
                If your periods seem irregular, or you’ve missed a period but know you’re not pregnant, it’s a good idea to talk with your doctor ASAP, as there are many reasons and conditions that could be causing the issue.
                <br />
                Your doctor can properly diagnose the reason for your late or missed period and discuss your treatment options. If you can, keep a record of changes in your cycle as well as other health changes. This will help them make a diagnosis.
                <br />
